00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,000
You successfully finished my course regarding preparing to JavaScript interview, and I think that you

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,860
are awesome if you finished it.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,520
Together, we implemented 59 JavaScript interview questions and actually a lot of them were not easy.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,700
If you didn't try it yourself, but just follow the loan.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,120
You can still do that.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,440
You can just randomly pick some video and try to implement it yourself, even if you saw it once, it

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,510
makes a lot of sense to try and do it.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,460
Also, I just want to remind you to not be depressed if you failed the interview.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,850
It will come with time and you will for sure, find your job.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,370
You just need to gather more knowledge, understand what questions you have been asked in the interviews,

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,290
and prepare yourself better.

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,280
I hope that you learned a lot and they will see you in my next course.
