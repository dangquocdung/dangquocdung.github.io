00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,620
One more important thing to remember is quite tricky, and people are not talking about it a lot and

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,840
then talking here about your program in vocabulary, what they mean by that.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,190
Actually, there are lots of words that you can use when you are talking about programming.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,470
So person, understand you better word list correctly and you should not mix them.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,720
And as a beginner, it might be really difficult for you because you don't know all this terms or you

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,150
are not really sure what you want to say, but you need to keep it in mind and try to improve with time.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,140
For example, you must really understand what you are saying.

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:39,690
For example, I showed a function or I created a method inside my class, or this is an instance of

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,290
the class.

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,930
You must use all this terms correctly.

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,520
If you see a function but you are calling its method or maybe your column, it's something else.

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,080
This is not correct.

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,110
And then you will get lots of additional questions or you will be seen as a bad developer and you of

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,100
course, don't want that.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,740
This is why you need to think a little bit what words you are using and try to use them correctly when

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,960
you are describing some program and stuff.
